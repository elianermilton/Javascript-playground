## **A Taste of Éliane**
### Marketing Software Developer

Welcome to my curated JavaScript environment.  
This space is designed as an atelier — a working studio where ideas are shaped through structure, clarity, and deliberate experimentation.

---

#### **Design Philosophy**
This repository reflects my approach to marketing design.  
Every code block is written with intention.  
Each step considers how humans think, perceive, and interpret structure.

My goal is to create a coding environment that feels intuitive, minimal, and psychologically grounded.

---

#### **Code Principles**
My work follows a structured set of principles that guide how I write, organize, and refine code.

**Simplicity:**  
Every function and file exists for a clear purpose. Excess is removed.

**Human-first structure:**  
Code is shaped around how people read, scan, and understand systems.

**Predictable patterns:**  
Naming, spacing, and flow stay consistent to reduce cognitive load.

**Clean separation:**  
Logic, structure, and visual design remain organized and distinct.

**Intentional detail:**  
Whitespace, indentation, and order communicate clarity.

These principles create a code environment that feels calm, readable, and maintainable.

## **Aesthetic Direction**
This repository follows a quiet, architectural style.  
The design language is minimal, structured, and rooted in soft neutral tones.

#### **Current Focus**
This atelier is an evolving space. Current explorations include:

- JavaScript fundamentals expressed through clean structure  
- Typing animations and interactive UI elements  
- Clean layout patterns for future components  
- Understanding how design psychology directs user attention  
- Controlled experiments in readability and cognitive flow

## **Purpose of This Repository**
This is more than a playground.  
It is a structured environment where small ideas become tangible through logic, pattern recognition, and iterative refinement.

Everything here reflects a mindset of clarity, precision, and intention.
